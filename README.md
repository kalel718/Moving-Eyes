Moving Eyes using HTML,CSS and JS

"Dive into this playful web experiment featuring a pair of interactive SVG eyes that charmingly follow your mouse cursor across the screen. This project is a neat demonstration of how powerful SVG can be for creating scalable, dynamic graphics, combined with CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript to bring simple, delightful interactivity to life. It's a fun way to explore event handling and SVG transformations, proving that even small details can add a lot of character to a web page."
